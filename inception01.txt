A CDN improves efficiency by introducing intermediary servers between the client and the website server. 
These CDN servers manage some of the client-server communications. 
They decrease web traffic to the web server, reduce bandwidth consumption,
and improve the user experience of your applications.

Without a CDN, all web requests will have to be accommodated by the host origin server itself.

It could be too much for the host server and it could lead to slow delivery of content, or worse, website failure.
